# Airbnb Clone Project 

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a real-world learning project designed to simulate the development of a scalable booking platform inspired by Airbnb.  
The project focuses on **backend systems, database design, API development, and application security**, while also exposing learners to collaborative workflows and modern DevOps practices.

## Learning Objective
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Team Roles
- **Business Analyst (BA)**: Bridges customer needs with technical implementation.

- **Product Owner (PO)**: Defines the product vision and ensures alignment with customer needs (often more business-focused than the BA).

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Oversees timelines, budgets, and team motivation.

- **UI/UX Designer**: Crafts user journeys and interface designs driven by usability and engagement.

- **Software Architect**: Shapes the technical architecture and sets coding standards.

- **Developers**: Front-end, back-end, or full-stack engineers who implement features.

- **QA Engineer**: Ensures functionality, performance, and security meet requirements.

- **Test Automation Engineer**: Builds automated testing systems to enhance quality and speed.

- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages CI/CD and streamlines delivery between development and operations.

## Technology Stack
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
1. **Users**
   - `id`
   - `name`
   - `email` (unique)
   - `password`
   - `role` (e.g., guest, host, admin)

2. **Properties**
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `location`
   - `price_per_night`

3. **Bookings**
   - `check_in_date`
   - `check_out_date`
   - `status` (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled)

4. **Payments**
   - `amount`
   - `payment_method`
   - `payment_status` (e.g., paid, pending, failed)

5. **Reviews**
   - `rating` (1–5)
   - `comment`

## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to protecting user data, financial transactions, and the integrity of the platform.  
The following measures will be implemented to ensure security and trustworthiness of the system:

1. **Authentication**
   - Users must log in with valid credentials (e.g., email & password) or through secure OAuth2 flows.  
   - Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.  

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (Guest, Host, Admin).  
   - Example: A Host can manage their own properties, but cannot access another Host’s listings.  
   - Protects system integrity by restricting actions to authorized roles only.  

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Restricts the number of API requests per user within a specific timeframe.  
   - Prevents abuse, brute-force login attempts, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  

4. **Data Encryption**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS to secure data transmission between client and server.  
   - Sensitive data (like passwords and payment info) stored with strong hashing/encryption algorithms.  

5. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Prevents malicious data entry, protecting against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  

6. **Secure Payments**
   - Payment-related endpoints will include additional security checks.  
   - Ensures financial data is processed securely and complies with industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).

### Why Security Matters
- **Users:** Protects sensitive personal information (names, emails, passwords). Prevents account takeover and ensures only authorized access.  

- **Properties:** Ensures listings cannot be tampered with or faked by malicious actors. Protects hosts’ data and keeps guests confident in the authenticity of available properties.  

- **Bookings:** Safeguards booking records so they cannot be altered, duplicated, or cancelled fraudulently. Ensures trust between guests and hosts.  

- **Payments:** Secures all financial transactions against fraud, misuse, and data breaches. Protects both guests and hosts by ensuring accurate, safe, and encrypted payment processing.  

- **Reviews:** Prevents fake or manipulated reviews that could mislead users. Maintains platform credibility by ensuring feedback is authentic and tied to real bookings.
