# Airbnb Clone Project 

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a real-world learning project designed to simulate the development of a scalable booking platform inspired by Airbnb.  
The project focuses on **backend systems, database design, API development, and application security**, while also exposing learners to collaborative workflows and modern DevOps practices.

## Learning Objective
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Django  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **API Layer**: GraphQL  
- **DevOps / Deployment**: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  
- **Collaboration & Documentation**: GitHub, Markdown  

## Team Roles
- **Business Analyst (BA)** — Bridges customer needs with technical implementation.

- **Product Owner (PO)** — Defines the product vision and ensures alignment with customer needs (often more business-focused than the BA).

- **Project Manager (PM)** — Oversees timelines, budgets, and team motivation.

- **UI/UX Designer** — Crafts user journeys and interface designs driven by usability and engagement.

- **Software Architect** — Shapes the technical architecture and sets coding standards.

- **Developers** — Front-end, back-end, or full-stack engineers who implement features.

- **QA Engineer** — Ensures functionality, performance, and security meet requirements.

- **Test Automation Engineer** — Builds automated testing systems to enhance quality and speed.

- **DevOps Engineer** — Manages CI/CD and streamlines delivery between development and operations.
